# 🛡️ VANGUARD: Versatile Aggregation for Networked Governance Using Unified AI with Reinforced Decisionin

![Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arjun4522/VanguardProd/main/snapshots/dash.jpeg)


**VANGUARD** is an advanced, modular network intrusion detection and governance system that integrates cutting-edge techniques in artificial intelligence (AI), federated learning, differential privacy (DP), and blockchain-inspired aggregation mechanisms to ensure real-time, scalable, and secure detection of network anomalies and cyber threats.

The system is designed to optimize the detection of malicious activities in highly distributed network environments, such as enterprise infrastructures or Internet of Things (IoT) networks. It leverages a combination of federated learning, reinforcement learning (RL), multi-party aggregation, and differential privacy to create a robust and adaptive defense system that evolves and adapts as new threats emerge, all while preserving the privacy of the data it processes.

## 🎯 Key Features and Components

### 🧠 Global and Local Model Architecture
- **🌐 Global Model**: A Random Forest model is initially trained on a large, public dataset (such as the CIC-IDS-2017 collection). This global model acts as a foundational intrusion detection engine.
- **🎯 Local Fine-Tuning**: The model is distributed to local nodes (such as remote devices or edge servers) where it undergoes fine-tuning. The fine-tuning process incorporates reinforcement learning (RL) for dynamic decision-making and uses Nash Bargaining to optimally allocate resources for differential privacy budget.

### 🔒 Differential Privacy (DP) and Privacy-Preserving Learning
To ensure the privacy of data used in training, the system introduces Gaussian noise into the fine-tuning process. This ensures the differential privacy of the individual data contributors and prevents leakage of sensitive information.

### 🤝 Federated Learning Framework
- **📡 Federated Learning** is employed to train machine learning models across distributed nodes without requiring the data to leave individual systems. This helps maintain data privacy and minimizes the need for expensive central storage or computation.
- The fine-tuned local models are aggregated back into the global model using a blockchain-inspired, reputation-based aggregation mechanism called **Multi-Krum**, which ensures robust aggregation even in the presence of Byzantine failures (faulty or malicious nodes).

### 🚨 Anomaly Detection with Random Forest Classifier
The system's core detection engine is based on a **Random Forest** algorithm, which is trained and continuously updated on network traffic patterns. This allows the system to detect anomalies (such as DDoS attacks, port scanning, or unauthorized access) effectively.

### ⚡ Real-Time Data Streaming and Monitoring
- The system employs a **🔄 Kafka-based** architecture for real-time message streaming and event processing. Network traffic data is captured and transmitted using **Scapy** for packet capture and **Kafka** for data streaming.
- In addition, **📊 Prometheus** and **📈 Grafana** are used for continuous monitoring of network performance and ML model metrics, providing a dashboard that visualizes both the network traffic and anomaly detection results in real time.

### 🛡️ Secure Aggregation and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)
The system ensures secure aggregation using **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)** mechanisms, which provide resilience against faulty nodes and ensure that malicious actions do not corrupt the global model.

The use of **Apache Kafka** enables secure communication between nodes, ensuring the efficient transmission of models and updates.

### 🌐 API and Real-Time Analytics
The system is integrated with a **FastAPI** backend that provides RESTful API access for querying system status, retrieving real-time anomaly data, and managing model updates.

Additionally, **⚡ Redis** is used for fast, in-memory data storage, providing efficient access to time-series data and ensuring low-latency performance for real-time analysis.

### 💻 Front-End Visualization
The **⚛️ React.js**-based frontend provides an intuitive, user-friendly dashboard for visualizing network traffic, model predictions, and anomaly detection results.

This dashboard includes dynamic visualizations of network data and statistics, using libraries like **React Force Graph** to display network topologies and traffic flows.
